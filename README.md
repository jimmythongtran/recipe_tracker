# Development log
### June 6, 2017
Spent much time simply re-setting up my environment. I want to find a one-click development set-up environment solution, but want to get back to the actual build. I spent time customizing my iTerm command line environment, which helps me clarify my workflow, so time well spent.

### June 2, 2017
Decided on using README as the place to document the development, more expansive than commit messages.
