# Development log
### June 6, 2017
Spent time studying more UNIX (thanks ls -F). Spent much time simply re-setting up my environment. I want to find a one-click development set-up environment solution, but want to get back to the actual build. I spent time customizing my iTerm command line environment, which helps me clarify my workflow, so time well spent. There was a major Github outage at 4:19pm, which messed up my flow. I mainly modified recipe_model.php with a constructor and functions on 'getting' my first and all (db)
recipe entries.

### June 2, 2017
Decided on using README as the place to document the development, more expansive than commit messages.
